This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to undefined array keys.  When accessing array elements using bracket notation, if the key doesn't exist, PHP will not throw an error, but will instead return null. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors further down the line, especially when using such values in arithmetic operations or comparisons.

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];

echo $myArray['c'] + 5; // This will output 5, not an error. 

// Example where the null is treated as 0 in an addition
$result = $myArray['c'] + 10; 
echo $result; // Prints 10

//Example where null is implicitly converted to an empty string
$greeting = "Hello, " . $myArray['d'];
echo $greeting; //Prints Hello,

?>
```
